# Remote Excellence

A practical guide for building distributed teams that actually work.

## About

Most companies treat remote work as an accommodation. The best treat it as a system. This book shows you how to build the latter.

Based on 20+ years leading remote teams across continents. No theory. No fluff. Just what works.

## What's Inside

37 chapters across 9 sections:

- **Before You Start** — Why this matters
- **The Foundation** — Trust as your operating system
- **Communication** — Async-first, meetings-last
- **Tools** — Less is more
- **Remote-First** — Commit fully or don't bother
- **Hiring** — Writers over talkers
- **Connection** — Humans first
- **Scaling** — What changes as you grow
- **Environment** — Let people work their way

## Read Online

## Previous Edition

The first edition took a different approach—eight broad principles instead of focused chapters. This edition breaks those principles into 37 actionable pieces.
