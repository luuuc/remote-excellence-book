I've been doing this for 20 years. Remote employee. Remote manager. Remote founder. I've made most of these mistakes myself.

## Who shaped this thinking

**Basecamp** — Jason Fried and DHH wrote the books I wish I'd had earlier. *Remote*, *Rework*, *It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work*. The DNA is obvious.

**GitLab** — 3,000 pages of public handbook. They showed what "remote-first" actually looks like at scale.

**Netflix** — "Highly aligned, loosely coupled." That phrase changed how I think about autonomy.

**Buffer** — Radical transparency before it was a buzzword. Honest about what doesn't work.

**Automattic** — Proof that 1,000+ people can work distributed. Not just survive. Thrive.

I took what they taught and mixed it with what I learned the hard way.
