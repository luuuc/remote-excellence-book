Remote enables something rare: sustained focus on what matters.

No commute. No interruptions. No performance theater. No meetings that should have been emails. Just the work.

That's the prize.

Build the system that protects it.

Monday morning. Quiet house. Hot coffee. Three hours before anyone expects a reply.

That's the system working.
