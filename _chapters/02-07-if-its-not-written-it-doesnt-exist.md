# If It's Not Written, It Doesn't Exist

This is the foundational rule of remote work. Verbal agreements evaporate. Slack threads get buried. Meeting decisions disappear.

Write down:
- Decisions and why you made them
- Processes and how they work
- Context that new people will need
- Agreements and expectations

Writing isn't overhead. It's the work.

The discipline of writing forces clarity. If you can't write it simply, you don't understand it well enough. If others can't find it, it might as well not exist.


> "We had a 'no decision without a doc' rule. At first people complained it slowed things down. Six months later, we realized we'd stopped having the same arguments twice. Everything was written, findable, and settled." — Head of Product, 80-person remote company


**The test:** Can someone who joins in six months find and understand this decision? If not, it doesn't exist.

Remote runs on written artifacts. Build that muscle.
