> Writing isn't overhead. It's the work.

This is the foundational rule of remote work. Verbal agreements evaporate. Slack threads get buried. Meeting decisions disappear.

Write down:
- Decisions and why you made them
- Processes and how they work
- Context that new people will need
- Agreements and expectations

Writing isn't overhead. It's the work.

The discipline of writing forces clarity. If you can't write it simply, you don't understand it well enough. If others can't find it, it might as well not exist.


**The test:** Can someone who joins in six months find and understand this decision? If not, it doesn't exist.

Remote runs on written artifacts. Build that muscle.
