Daily standups made sense in offices. Fifteen minutes to sync before diving into work.

They make no sense for distributed teams.

You're either forcing some people into terrible time zones, or you're excluding others entirely. Either way, it's a meeting that could be a message.

Replace it.

Written updates, posted at the start of each person's day. What you did. What you're doing. What's blocking you.

Everyone reads on their own time. Context is captured. Time zones don't matter.

You'll get better information. And you'll get everyone's hours back.
