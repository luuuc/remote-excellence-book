Where does information live?

If the answer is "depends," you have a problem.

Decisions in Slack. Context in Notion. Tasks in Linear. Updates in email. Nothing is findable. Everything is duplicated. Half of it is stale.

Pick a system. Enforce it.

One place for documentation. One place for project status. One place for decisions. Link between them, but be clear about where the canonical version lives.

When someone asks "where do I find X?" the answer should be immediate and obvious.

Centralization isn't bureaucracy. It's clarity.
