# Building Real Connection {#chapter-8-1}

Remote work creates an interesting tension. Team members are physically distant yet often experience more intimate glimpses into each other's lives than traditional office workers ever do. Children interrupt calls, pets make appearances, home environments become visible backgrounds. The line between work and personal life becomes inevitably permeable.

Many organizations try to minimize these intrusions, treating them as unprofessional interruptions to be managed away. The teams that thrive remotely often take the opposite approach.

> "The strongest remote connections happen when we bring our whole selves to work, not just our professional facades."

In previous chapters, we've explored the systems and structures that enable effective distributed work: trust as the foundation, communication architecture, tech stack, methodologies, remote-first practices, and scaling approaches. These elements create the framework for successful remote collaboration.

Yet there's a human dimension that transcends these systems. Remote work creates a unique paradox: team members are physically distant yet often experience more intimate glimpses into each other's lives than in traditional office environments. Children interrupt calls, pets make appearances, home environments become visible backgrounds. The separation between work and personal life becomes inevitably permeable.

The organizations that thrive remotely embrace an interesting paradox: they treat professional boundary blurring as a strategic advantage rather than a problem to solve. They recognize that authenticity isn't just nice to have. It's essential for building the trust, psychological safety, and human connection that underpin truly effective remote teams.

In this article, we'll explore why authenticity matters so much in remote work, how to foster cultures where bringing your whole self to work becomes a strategic advantage rather than a liability, and practical approaches for building real connection across distances.

# Why Authenticity Matters More in Remote Environments {#chapter-8-2}

In traditional offices, people often adopt "work personas" distinct from their authentic selves. Remote work blurs these boundaries in meaningful ways:

## 1. Home Contexts Become Visible

Working from home inevitably reveals aspects of our personal lives that would remain hidden in an office setting.

**Why this matters**:
- Pretending these contexts don't exist creates cognitive strain
- Acknowledging real-life circumstances builds empathy and understanding
- Shared humanity becomes a connecting force across distances

{% include callout/example.html content="In a traditional office, a parent might simply say they need to leave at 5pm sharp. In a remote environment, their colleagues might occasionally see their children appear in the background of a video call, hear them calling from another room, or notice toys in the home office. This visibility can either be treated as an embarrassing intrusion to be apologized for, or normalized as part of working with whole humans who have lives beyond their professional roles." %}

## 2. Working Styles Become Apparent

Natural productivity rhythms and preferences emerge when freed from office norms.

**Why this matters**:
- Pretending everyone works best the same way ignores reality
- Acknowledging different styles allows optimization for actual productivity
- Respecting diverse approaches builds trust and reduces impostor feelings

{% include callout/example.html content="In an office environment, everyone typically follows the same 9-5 schedule regardless of their natural productivity patterns. In a remote setting, it becomes apparent that some team members are early birds who do their best work at 6am, while others are night owls who hit their stride after dinner. Some prefer marathon deep work sessions, while others are most effective in shorter, focused blocks. These differences become visible in async communication patterns and can either be treated as deviations to be corrected or valuable diversity to be embraced." %}

## 3. Communication Becomes More Deliberate

Written communication reveals thinking patterns more clearly than office small talk.

**Why this matters**:
- Written expression often reveals more of someone's authentic voice
- Digital communication requires more explicit sharing of context and feelings
- Deliberate communication creates space for reflection and intentionality

{% include callout/example.html content="In an office, much communication happens through quick verbal exchanges that are often reactive and shallow. In remote environments, the shift toward written communication often reveals more of people's authentic thinking patterns, communication styles, and perspectives. This written record creates opportunities for deeper understanding of colleagues as whole people with unique viewpoints and approaches." %}

Rather than fighting these realities, successful remote organizations embrace them as strengths. ðŸ’«

This approach acknowledges that having clear opinions and authentic expression creates more effective outcomes than trying to be all things to all people. Remote teams should embrace the authentic expression of their members.

# Common Pitfalls in Creating Authentic Remote Cultures {#chapter-8-3}

Even organizations that value authenticity struggle with implementation:

## 1. Forced Vulnerability

**The problem**: Pressuring team members to share personal information before trust is established, creating discomfort and potential boundary violations.

**Solution**: Create opt-in sharing opportunities with clear boundaries, allowing team members to determine their own comfort level with personal disclosure.

**Implementation**: Design social activities and sharing opportunities that are explicitly optional, with multiple ways to participate at different levels of personal disclosure.

## 2. Authenticity Without Boundaries

**The problem**: Confusion about appropriate levels of personal disclosure, leading to oversharing that creates awkwardness or unprofessionalism.

**Solution**: Develop clear "personal vs. private" guidelines that help team members understand the difference between bringing their authentic selves to work and sharing details better kept outside professional contexts.

**Implementation**: Create simple frameworks for distinguishing between personal sharing that builds connection (appropriate) and private details that might create discomfort (inappropriate), with specific examples to illustrate the difference.

## 3. Inconsistent Leader Authenticity

**The problem**: Leaders expecting authenticity from team members while maintaining rigid professional personas themselves, creating a "do as I say, not as I do" dynamic that undermines trust.

**Solution**: Leadership demonstrating appropriate vulnerability first, modeling the level of authenticity expected from the team while maintaining professional boundaries.

**Implementation**: Train leaders on appropriate vulnerability, create opportunities for them to share challenges or learning moments authentically, and recognize when they demonstrate this behavior effectively.

## 4. Cultural Variation Blindness

**The problem**: Applying one cultural standard of authenticity across diverse global teams, ignoring that norms around personal disclosure vary significantly across cultures.

**Solution**: Develop cross-cultural sensitivity around authenticity norms, recognizing that comfort with personal sharing varies widely across different cultural backgrounds.

**Implementation**: Provide education about cultural differences in self-disclosure, create flexible approaches that accommodate diverse comfort levels, and avoid judging team members whose cultural norms differ from the dominant culture.

## 5. Authenticity Without Psychological Safety

**The problem**: Expecting open communication without creating safe conditions first, leading to reluctance to share or potential negative consequences for authenticity.

**Solution**: Establish trust fundamentals before emphasizing authenticity, ensuring team members feel genuinely safe being themselves.

**Implementation**: Focus first on creating an environment where mistakes are treated as learning opportunities, feedback is delivered constructively, and people are valued regardless of differences, then gradually encourage more authentic expression as safety increases.

{% include callout/hint.html content="Authenticity isn't about sharing everything. It's about bringing your genuine self within appropriate professional boundaries." %}

# How to Foster Authentic Remote Culture {#chapter-8-4}

As a leader, model and encourage authenticity, even when it feels awkward:

## 1. Create Safety First

Before people will bring their authentic selves to work, they need to know it's safe to do so.

**Implementation approach**:

### Make it Clear That Authenticity is Valued

- Explicitly discuss authenticity in team values
- Share examples of how authenticity strengthens the team
- Create clear guidelines about respectful interaction
- Establish what is and isn't appropriate to share

### Support People When They Share Challenges

- Respond with empathy when personal issues arise
- Create flexible approaches to work during personal challenges
- Implement support systems for team members in difficulty
- Follow up privately after public vulnerability

### Show Vulnerability by Acknowledging Your Own Limits

- Leaders should model appropriate vulnerability
- Share your own challenges and learning moments
- Admit when you don't know something
- Ask for help when you need it

### Lead Difficult Conversations Constructively

- Address tensions directly but respectfully
- Create frameworks for productive disagreement
- Implement retrospectives focused on team dynamics
- Provide conflict resolution resources

{% include callout/example.html content="During a particularly challenging product launch, you might openly share your concerns about the timeline with your team. By acknowledging that you're feeling overwhelmed and asking for input on how to prioritize, you create space for team members to share their own concerns. This approach often leads to more realistic planning and prevents burnout. By showing vulnerability first as a leader, you make it safer for others to be authentic about their capacity and concerns." %}

This approach recognizes that psychological safety is a prerequisite for both wellbeing and high performance. Remote leaders should create environments where people feel safe bringing their authentic selves to work.

## 2. Normalize Life Integration

Remote work inevitably means that personal and professional lives intersect. Rather than pretending otherwise, acknowledge and accommodate this reality.

**Implementation approach**:

### Acknowledge Family Responsibilities Openly

- Create explicit policies about family interruptions
- Share examples of healthy boundaries between work and family
- Implement family-friendly scheduling practices
- Provide flexibility for family emergencies

### Encourage Blocking Calendar Time for Personal Needs

- Normalize calendar blocks for personal activities
- Share examples of appropriate personal calendar management
- Implement "no meeting" blocks to protect personal time
- Create cultural permission to prioritize wellbeing

### Accept Interruptions During Calls as Normal

- Establish team norms around call interruptions
- Create playful responses to common interruptions
- Implement technical solutions for managing interruptions
- Use interruptions as opportunities for human connection

### Design Workflows That Accommodate Life

- Create asynchronous alternatives for key processes
- Implement flexible deadlines where possible
- Build redundancy into critical roles
- Design for the reality of human lives, not idealized workers

{% include callout/example.html content="Your remote team might create a simple signal that team members can use in chat or during video calls when they need to step away unexpectedly, perhaps a specific emoji or quick message template. This removes the need for lengthy explanations and creates guilt-free permission to handle whatever's happening. The team understands the person will follow up when they can. This approach significantly reduces stress around inevitable interruptions while ensuring nothing important falls through the cracks." %}

This approach embraces a practical approach to development, acknowledging and working with reality rather than fighting against it. Remote teams should create norms that acknowledge the reality of integrated work and personal lives.

## 3. Welcome Different Work Styles

One of remote work's greatest strengths is allowing people to work in ways that match their natural productivity patterns. Embrace this diversity rather than enforcing unnecessary uniformity.

**Implementation approach**:

### Recognize People Work Best in Different Patterns

- Create explicit permission for varied work schedules
- Implement core collaboration hours with flexibility outside those times
- Share examples of different productive work patterns
- Focus on outcomes rather than specific work hours

### Support Night Owls and Early Birds

- Design asynchronous workflows that accommodate different schedules
- Create documentation for time-shifted collaboration
- Implement tools that work across time preferences
- Rotate meeting times to share the burden of inconvenient scheduling

### Focus Feedback on Results, Not Work Hours

- Define clear deliverables and timelines
- Create objective evaluation criteria based on outcomes
- Implement regular check-ins focused on progress and blockers
- Design recognition programs that celebrate results rather than work patterns

### Build Systems That Support Varied Work Styles

- Implement tools that work across time zones and schedules
- Create documentation that facilitates async handoffs
- Design processes with flexibility in timing
- Create visibility into progress without micromanagement

{% include callout/example.html content="In your remote organization, you might discover an exceptional senior developer who is also a parent of young children. Their most productive hours might be early mornings and late evenings, with a significant break in the afternoon for family time. Rather than forcing them into a traditional 9-5 schedule, you could establish core collaboration hours (perhaps 11am-2pm) when they're available for meetings and synchronous work. Outside those hours, they work according to their own rhythm. This flexibility often results in outstanding productivity and work quality, plus the team benefits from coverage during non-standard hours when emergencies arise." %}

This flexibility creates structures that support productivity without unnecessary constraints. Having sensible defaults while allowing customization where needed.

## 4. Document Communication Preferences

In remote settings, understanding how team members prefer to communicate becomes essential for effective collaboration.

**Implementation approach**:

### Create Clear Guides About Expectations

- Establish team-wide communication norms
- Document response time expectations by channel
- Create guidelines for urgent vs. non-urgent communication
- Implement regular reviews of communication effectiveness

### Address Cultural Differences in Styles

- Provide education about cross-cultural communication
- Create explicit space for clarifying misunderstandings
- Implement processes for navigating cultural differences
- Design communication systems that work across cultural contexts

### Let People Express How They Prefer to Work

- Create individual communication preference profiles
- Implement systems for sharing these preferences
- Design onboarding that captures communication styles
- Build team awareness of different communication needs

### Adapt Approaches Based on Individual Needs

- Create flexibility in communication methods
- Implement multiple channels for different preferences
- Design processes that accommodate different styles
- Build awareness of neurodiversity in communication needs

{% include callout/example.html content="Your remote team might implement 'team README files' where each team member documents their working style, communication preferences, and best collaboration approaches. New team members create these during onboarding, with the whole team reviewing them quarterly. These simple documents can dramatically reduce misunderstandings and friction. For instance, knowing that one person prefers detailed written feedback before discussion while another thinks better by talking through ideas first can transform collaboration patterns and reduce tension." %}

This approach provides clear defaults while allowing customization for individual needs.

# Why Authenticity Initially Feels Uncomfortable {#chapter-8-5}

For many leaders and team members, bringing authenticity to work represents a significant departure from traditional professional environments. The discomfort is normal for several reasons:

## 1. Professional Conditioning

Most of us were taught to maintain strict boundaries between personal and professional identities. Breaking these patterns feels risky.

**Why this happens**:
- Traditional workplace norms emphasize separating work and personal life
- Professional education often focuses on presenting an idealized work persona
- Many workplaces implicitly punish authentic expression of challenges or differences

**How to address it**:
- Recognize this conditioning explicitly
- Create gradual opportunities to practice appropriate authenticity
- Celebrate examples of authentic expression that led to positive outcomes
- Share research on the benefits of authenticity in professional settings

## 2. Vulnerability Concerns

Sharing authentic challenges can feel like admitting weakness in environments where strength is valued.

**Why this happens**:
- Many workplace cultures equate vulnerability with incompetence
- Revealing challenges feels risky when evaluation systems reward perfection
- Past experiences of vulnerability being used against people create lasting caution

**How to address it**:
- Start with leaders modeling appropriate vulnerability
- Create clear separation between vulnerability and performance evaluation
- Celebrate vulnerability that leads to learning and improvement
- Build trust gradually through consistent positive responses to authentic sharing

## 3. Management Uncertainty

Leading authentic teams requires more nuanced approaches than one-size-fits-all policies. This complexity can feel overwhelming.

**Why this happens**:
- Managing authentic teams requires greater emotional intelligence
- Traditional management training rarely addresses how to handle authenticity
- Creating equitable flexibility feels more complex than rigid uniformity

**How to address it**:
- Provide specific training on leading authentic remote teams
- Create peer support networks for leaders to discuss challenges
- Document successful approaches to managing with authenticity
- Recognize and reward effective authentic leadership

## 4. Fear of Inappropriate Disclosure

Without clear guidelines, people worry about sharing too much or in ways that might make others uncomfortable.

**Why this happens**:
- Boundaries between appropriate and inappropriate sharing can feel blurry
- Cultural and individual differences create varying comfort zones
- Few workplaces provide explicit guidance on appropriate authenticity

**How to address it**:
- Create clear frameworks for distinguishing personal from private
- Share specific examples of appropriate and inappropriate sharing
- Provide safe feedback mechanisms when boundaries are crossed
- Build understanding through open discussion of comfort zones

Like learning any new skill, authentic remote leadership feels awkward at first. But with practice, it becomes natural and significantly more effective than maintaining artificial separation between professional and personal selves.

This parallels the learning curve of any new framework or approach. The initial discomfort gives way to fluency and then to appreciation for the benefits the new approach brings, just as learning a new language might initially feel constraining but ultimately enables greater productivity.

# The Business Case for Authentic Remote Teams {#chapter-8-6}

Authenticity delivers real business value, not just feel-good benefits:

## 1. Reduced Cognitive Load

People spend less energy maintaining a work persona, freeing mental capacity for actual work.

**Business impact**:
- More mental energy available for problem-solving and creativity
- Reduced stress and burnout from constant persona maintenance
- Greater capacity to handle work challenges without additional strain
- More sustainable high performance over time

{% include callout/example.html content="When team members no longer need to hide reality (like childcare needs or the fatigue of pretending to be a morning person when they're not), they reclaim significant mental energy. This translates directly into more capacity for the actual challenges of work, rather than the additional challenge of maintaining appearances." %}

## 2. Increased Engagement

Authentic environments boost retention and motivation, as people feel valued for who they truly are.

**Business impact**:
- Higher retention rates, reducing costly turnover
- Stronger intrinsic motivation and discretionary effort
- Greater willingness to go above and beyond when needed
- More honest feedback about challenges and opportunities

{% include callout/example.html content="Organizations that embrace authenticity typically see retention improvements of 30-40%, particularly among top performers who have options elsewhere. When people feel they can bring their whole selves to work rather than conforming to rigid expectations, their commitment to the organization strengthens significantly." %}

## 3. Better Collaboration

Understanding colleagues' real styles improves teamwork and reduces friction in working relationships.

**Business impact**:
- Faster development of effective working relationships
- More effective team composition based on actual styles and strengths
- Reduced time lost to communication misunderstandings
- More complementary collaboration leveraging diverse approaches

{% include callout/example.html content="When team members understand each other's authentic working and communication styles, collaboration improves dramatically. Instead of everyone trying to conform to a single 'professional' approach, teams can leverage their diversity, with some members excelling at big-picture thinking while others focus on details, some preferring verbal exploration while others process information in writing." %}

## 4. Faster Problem-Solving

Teams that can speak freely catch issues earlier and bring more diverse perspectives to solutions.

**Business impact**:
- Earlier identification of potential problems
- More diverse solution approaches being considered
- Greater innovation through authentic perspective sharing
- Reduced project failures due to unaddressed concerns

{% include callout/example.html content="In authentic remote environments, team members feel safe raising concerns early rather than waiting until issues become critical. The engineer who spots a potential architecture flaw, the designer who notices usability concerns, or the customer support specialist who identifies a potential user pain point all speak up without fear, allowing teams to address problems when they're still small." %}

## 5. Higher Trust

Authenticity builds the foundation essential for remote work, creating resilience during challenges.

**Business impact**:
- Stronger team cohesion during difficult periods
- Greater resilience in the face of challenges
- More transparent communication during uncertainty
- Faster recovery from setbacks or failures

{% include callout/example.html content="When a remote team faces a significant challenge, like a critical system failure or a major market shift, the level of trust built through authentic relationships becomes invaluable. Teams with high trust respond more effectively to crises, communicate more transparently about challenges, and recover more quickly from setbacks." %}

Leaders who initially resist "unprofessional" authentic elements often change their minds after seeing results. Companies that embrace authenticity typically see retention improve by 30-40% and problems decrease by half as team members feel safe raising concerns early.

This business value emphasizes productivity in its purest form. It recognizes that creating environments where people can work naturally leads to better outcomes than forcing artificial constraints.

# The Remote Leader's Authenticity Checklist {#chapter-8-7}

To foster authentic remote culture, use this practical checklist:

## 1. Audit Your Policies

Do they acknowledge the whole person or treat employees as interchangeable resources?

**Implementation approach**:
- Review policies for rigid requirements that ignore human realities
- Identify where flexibility could be introduced without compromising outcomes
- Create exceptions processes for unique circumstances
- Design policies that treat people as adults capable of good judgment

**Example questions**:
- Do our work hours policies accommodate different life circumstances?
- Do our communication expectations account for various working styles?
- Do our meeting practices respect people's time and energy?
- Do our performance evaluation processes measure what truly matters?

## 2. Examine Your Reactions

How do you respond when team members share personal challenges?

**Implementation approach**:
- Create scripts for responding supportively to personal disclosures
- Implement training for leaders on empathetic responses
- Design support systems for team members facing challenges
- Build processes for accommodating temporary needs

**Example questions**:
- Do I demonstrate appropriate empathy when team members share difficulties?
- Do I create solutions that accommodate temporary life challenges?
- Do I follow up appropriately after personal disclosures?
- Do I model appropriate vulnerability in my own communications?

## 3. Review Your Communication

Are you sharing appropriate context about your own situation and challenges?

**Implementation approach**:
- Create guidelines for appropriate leadership vulnerability
- Implement communication training for leaders
- Design templates for contextual communications
- Build feedback mechanisms to improve leadership communication

**Example questions**:
- Do I share appropriate context about my own challenges?
- Do I model the vulnerability I want to see from my team?
- Do I communicate in ways that feel authentic rather than performative?
- Do I create space for others' authentic expression?

## 4. Check Your Assumptions

Are you making judgments based on when or how people work rather than outcomes?

**Implementation approach**:
- Implement outcome-based evaluation criteria
- Create visibility into results without micromanagement
- Design feedback processes focused on deliverables
- Build recognition systems that celebrate impact

**Example questions**:
- Do I focus on results rather than working patterns?
- Do I accommodate different productive styles?
- Do I recognize diverse approaches to achieving outcomes?
- Do I value contribution over conformity?

# Navigating the Authenticity Boundary {#chapter-8-8}

While embracing authenticity creates significant benefits, it's important to establish appropriate boundaries. Not everything from our personal lives belongs in professional contexts.

## Creating Clear Guidelines

**Implementation approach**:

### 1. Define appropriate sharing

- Create explicit guidelines about appropriate topics
- Implement examples of healthy boundaries
- Design processes for addressing boundary concerns
- Build team awareness of cultural and individual differences

### 2. Distinguish between personal and private

- Clarify the difference between personal (appropriate to share) and private (best kept confidential)
- Implement training on appropriate disclosure
- Create examples of healthy sharing
- Build understanding of contextual appropriateness

### 3. Respect individual comfort levels

- Acknowledge varied comfort with personal sharing
- Create opt-in rather than mandatory sharing opportunities
- Design multiple ways to connect authentically
- Build respect for different authenticity expressions

### 4. Address cultural differences

- Recognize cultural variation in disclosure norms
- Implement cross-cultural communication training
- Create space for discussing cultural differences
- Build inclusive practices that work across cultures

{% include callout/example.html content="Your remote organization might create a simple framework called 'Personal, not Private' to help your team navigate appropriate sharing. Personal includes things like mentioning you're having a challenging day, sharing a hobby you're excited about, or acknowledging a family situation affecting your work. Private includes details about relationships, financial specifics, or health information beyond what impacts work. This clarity helps people bring their authentic selves to work without oversharing in ways that might create discomfort." %}

This balanced approach provides clear guardrails while respecting individual agency.

# The Special Challenge of Remote Onboarding {#chapter-8-9}

Integrating new team members into an authentic remote culture requires special attention:

## Creating Connection for New Team Members

**Implementation approach**:

### 1. Structured but authentic introductions

- Design introduction formats that reveal personality
- Implement "get to know you" sessions beyond work topics
- Create opportunities for new hires to share their authentic selves
- Build connection rituals that feel natural, not forced

### 2. Explicit cultural documentation

- Document the team's approach to authenticity
- Implement clear guidelines about communication norms
- Create examples of appropriate authentic expression
- Build resources for navigating team culture

### 3. Intentional relationship building

- Design connection opportunities with existing team members
- Implement buddy systems for new hires
- Create structured but natural getting-to-know-you processes
- Build psychological safety for new team members

### 4. Gradual integration

- Recognize that authenticity develops over time
- Implement progressive engagement opportunities
- Create safe spaces for questions and clarification
- Build patience for cultural integration

{% include callout/example.html content="When onboarding new remote team members, you might develop a 'Personal User Manual' template that new hires complete during their first week. This document includes professional information (working style, communication preferences) but also appropriate personal elements (background, interests, what energizes and drains them). New hires share this document with the team, and existing team members share theirs in return. This creates authentic connection quickly while maintaining appropriate boundaries." %}

This structured approach creates clear pathways that make the right behaviors easy and natural.

# Moving Forward {#chapter-8-10}

## Definition of Done

You've successfully fostered authenticity in your remote team when:

1. Team members comfortably share appropriate personal context that impacts their work
2. People across the organization feel safe bringing their whole selves to work
3. Different working styles and personal circumstances are accommodated without judgment
4. Issues and challenges are raised early because people feel safe being honest
5. Team connection feels genuine rather than forced or performative
6. New members integrate smoothly into the team's authentic culture
7. Communication reflects individual voices rather than corporate-speak
8. The organization bends to accommodate human realities rather than expecting humans to twist themselves into organizational molds

Remember that building authentic remote culture is an ongoing journey, not a destination. Like maintaining a well-crafted codebase, it requires continuous attention and refinement. The benefits â€“ higher engagement, better collaboration, increased innovation, and improved retention â€“ make this investment one of the highest-ROI activities for remote leaders.

## Recap

To maximize the value of in-person gatherings, plan activities that build lasting relationships, respect personal boundaries, and maintain connection between formal events through regular rituals and thoughtfully leveraged digital tools.

The investment you make in these experiences creates the relational foundation that enables your distributed team to build great things together, regardless of where they sit.

## Next Up

Building authentic remote culture creates the foundation for meaningful connection, but it requires deliberate reinforcement through experiences that bring your distributed team together purposefully.

In our final chapter, "Designing Effective Remote Events and Gatherings," we'll explore creating virtual and in-person experiences that strengthen relationships enabling exceptional collaboration. The most effective remote companies are remote by default with intentional synchronous connection.

You'll learn when virtual events truly engage versus feel like obligations, how to design gatherings that create lasting impact, and practical approaches for maintaining connection. We'll tackle the ROI showing why periodic retreats often cost less than office space while delivering superior results.
