# Remote Is a System, Not a Perk

Remote work isn't a policy. It's a system.

Most companies treat remote like a benefit—something they offer. Flexible hours. Work from anywhere. No commute.

That's thinking small.

Remote done right is a competitive advantage. You hire from everywhere. You operate across time zones. You build a culture of written clarity that scales.

Remote done wrong is isolation, miscommunication, and slow death by video call.

The difference isn't the tools. It's the system.

This book is about the system.
