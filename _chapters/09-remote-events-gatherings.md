# Building Connection Beyond Screens {#chapter-9-1}

> "The most effective remote companies aren't remote 100% of the time. They're remote by default with purposeful in-person connection."

While daily work happens asynchronously, intentional synchronous events remain valuable for building relationships and alignment. In my experience, I've discovered that deliberate gatherings - when designed with clear purpose and thoughtful execution - create exponential returns in team cohesion, trust, and shared understanding.

In this chapter, we'll explore how to design these experiences to maximize their impact, whether they're virtual or in-person.

# The Purpose of Remote Events {#chapter-9-2}

Before diving into implementation details, let's clarify why remote events matter in the first place:

## Why Gather at All?

Remote events serve specific purposes that asynchronous work can't fully address:

1. Relationship building - Creating human connections beyond work transactions
2. Alignment creation - Developing shared understanding of direction and priorities
3. Creative collaboration - Generating ideas through real-time interaction
4. Cultural reinforcement - Strengthening values and shared identity
5. Celebration and recognition - Marking achievements and honoring contributions

When designed intentionally, these events provide the social glue that helps remote teams withstand challenges and maintain cohesion despite physical distance.

Just as good conventions free developers to focus on business logic, well-designed gatherings create the relational foundation that enables remote teams to focus on building great products together.

# Common Pitfalls in Remote Team Events {#chapter-9-3}

Many remote organizations struggle with creating effective gatherings:

## 1. The Awkward Happy Hour

- Forced social interactions that feel artificial and draining
- Solution: Design structured activities with clear purpose and natural interaction points

## 2. The Half-Present Participant Problem

- Team members multitasking during virtual events
- Solution: Create engaging formats that require active participation and shorter session lengths

## 3. Hybrid Meeting Inequality

- In-room participants having advantages over remote ones
- Solution: Implement "one person, one camera" policies even for partially co-located teams

## 4. Timezone Exclusionary Scheduling

- Regular events at times that consistently disadvantage certain regions
- Solution: Implement rotating schedules and asynchronous alternatives

## 5. Technical Friction Fatigue

- Poor audio/video quality creating communication barriers
- Solution: Invest in quality equipment and conduct technical checks before important events

{% include callout/warning.html content="Even well-designed remote events fail when technical issues prevent equal participation." %}

# How-to: Create Meaningful Team Events {#chapter-9-4}

Let's start with team-level virtual events before exploring company-wide and in-person gatherings:

## 1. Design for Equal Participation

The fundamental principle for all remote gatherings is ensuring everyone can participate equally, regardless of location.

**Implementation approach**:

### 1. Equal technical setup

- Ensure everyone has appropriate equipment for full participation
- Create technical guidelines for optimal experience
- Provide support for setting up effective home environments
- Test connections and equipment before important sessions

### 2. Deliberate inclusion practices

- Implement active facilitation to include all voices
- Create participation structures beyond open discussion
- Design processes for gathering input from everyone
- Build awareness of participation patterns and biases

### 3. Mixed-mode considerations

- If bringing people together physically, ensure remote participants have equal presence
- Consider "all-remote" or "all-in-person" rather than hybrid for important events
- Use facilitators who actively incorporate remote participants
- Design activities that work equally well for in-person and remote participants

{% include callout/example.html content="For quarterly planning sessions, you might initially try having part of the team in a conference room with remote participants on screen, only to find this creates a clear in-group/out-group dynamic where remote voices are less heard. Switching to an 'all-digital-first' approach where even people in the same physical location join from individual devices can dramatically improve engagement from everyone. For the final social portion, the in-person group can gather while remote participants join in ways that work for them." %}

This ensures the experience works well for everyone rather than optimizing for some at the expense of others.

## 2. Technical Setup Matters Enormously

The quality of the technical experience directly impacts the quality of connection possible.

**Implementation approach**:

### 1. Invest in high-quality audio

- Prioritize audio quality above all other factors
- Provide quality microphones for all team members
- Create guidelines for optimal audio setup
- Test and troubleshoot audio issues proactively

### 2. Optimize video when used

- Ensure adequate lighting for video calls
- Create background guidelines that balance authenticity and professionalism
- Implement best practices for camera positioning
- Consider when video adds value versus when it creates unnecessary cognitive load

### 3. Provide technical support

- Assign a dedicated technical facilitator for larger events
- Create troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Implement backup plans for technical failures
- Build in time buffers for resolving technical challenges

### 4. Choose appropriate platforms

- Select platforms that support your specific event goals
- Create familiarity with tools before important events
- Implement platform training for all participants
- Build awareness of platform limitations and workarounds

{% include callout/example.html content="You might learn the hard way that poor audio quality is the fastest way to make remote participants feel excluded. Providing a standard audio setup (specific headset model) to every team member as part of their onboarding can make a significant difference. For important team events, implementing a 'tech check' 15 minutes before the official start where everyone confirms their audio is working properly can prevent frustrating delays. This small investment can dramatically improve your virtual gatherings." %}

This technical foundation creates the infrastructure that enables effective interaction.

## 3. Structure Interaction Intentionally

Thoughtful interaction design creates more engaging and productive remote events.

**Implementation approach**:

### 1. Use tools that allow equal contribution

- Implement digital whiteboards for visual collaboration
- Create collaborative documents for real-time contribution
- Design polling and feedback mechanisms
- Build processes for capturing diverse input

### 2. Create explicit opportunities for input

- Design structured discussion formats
- Implement round-robin participation for key decisions
- Create multiple channels for contribution (verbal, chat, collaborative docs)
- Build in reflection time before discussion

### 3. Break larger groups into smaller discussion units

- Use breakout rooms for deeper discussion
- Create small group activities with clear outputs
- Implement rotation patterns to mix perspectives
- Build cross-pollination mechanisms between small groups

### 4. Design for different interaction preferences

- Create opportunities for both synchronous and asynchronous contribution
- Implement both verbal and written input channels
- Design for both extroverted and introverted participation styles
- Build flexibility into participation expectations

{% include callout/example.html content="For monthly all-hands meetings, try moving from a typical presentation format to a structured approach called '3-3-3': 3 minutes of presentation, 3 minutes of small group discussion in breakout rooms, and 3 minutes of full-group discussion and Q&A. This pattern can repeat for each major topic. Engagement often skyrockets, allowing you to hear from voices that were previously silent. Sending the agenda in advance with pre-meeting questions also allows for asynchronous input from those who process information differently." %}

This structured approach creates predictable patterns that enable more effective participation.

## 4. Balance Synchronous and Asynchronous Components

The most effective remote events combine real-time interaction with asynchronous elements.

**Implementation approach**:

### 1. Design events with pre-work and post-event activities

- Create meaningful pre-event materials and activities
- Implement processes for capturing pre-event input
- Design post-event follow-up mechanisms
- Build continuity between asynchronous and synchronous components

### 2. Record key sessions for those who cannot attend live

- Implement high-quality recording procedures
- Create effective distribution methods for recordings
- Design experiences for asynchronous participants
- Build inclusion for those who can't attend synchronously

### 3. Create artifacts that capture value beyond the live experience

- Design documentation processes during events
- Implement effective note-taking and summarization
- Create visual artifacts from collaborative sessions
- Build searchable archives of event outcomes

### 4. Design for time zone equity

- Rotate meeting times to share inconvenience fairly
- Implement multiple session options for global teams
- Create asynchronous alternatives for critical content
- Build awareness of time zone impact on participation

{% include callout/example.html content="For quarterly strategic planning, consider developing a three-phase approach: 1) Pre-work: Team members review objectives and submit initial thoughts asynchronously over a three-day period, 2) Synchronous session: A 2-hour video call to discuss key questions and make decisions, 3) Post-work: Documentation of decisions and implementation planning in collaborative documents over the following week. This approach respects everyone's time while ensuring all voices contribute to your direction." %}

This balanced approach finds the right mix of components to create the most effective overall system.

# When to Bring Everyone Together {#chapter-9-5}

Physical gatherings remain valuable when:

## 1. Onboarding new team members

- Creating initial connection and belonging
- Establishing cultural understanding
- Building foundational relationships
- Accelerating integration into the team

## 2. Strategic planning and vision-setting

- Aligning on long-term direction
- Working through complex trade-offs
- Building shared understanding of priorities
- Creating collective ownership of strategy

## 3. Building relationships outside of work contexts

- Developing multi-dimensional connections
- Creating social bonds beyond professional roles
- Building trust through shared experiences
- Humanizing digital relationships

## 4. Complex problem-solving requiring intensive collaboration

- Working through particularly challenging issues
- Breaking through stuck points in projects
- Generating creative solutions collaboratively
- Resolving tensions that are difficult to address remotely

When designing in-person gatherings, make them count. Focus on activities that truly benefit from physical presence, rather than work that could be done remotely.

This selective approach focuses resources where they create the most value rather than trying to do everything.

# How-to: Implement Meaningful IRL Events for Remote Teams {#chapter-9-6}

Investing in in-person gatherings is paradoxically one of the most important aspects of successful remote organizations. When implemented correctly, these events strengthen culture, build relationships, and ultimately improve remote collaboration.

## 1. Annual or Bi-Annual Company Retreats

Company-wide gatherings create foundational connection and alignment.

**Implementation approach**:

### 1. Focus on relationship-building and strategic alignment

- Design experiences that build connections across teams
- Create opportunities for meaningful interaction beyond work roles
- Implement activities that reinforce company culture and values
- Build shared understanding of strategic direction

### 2. Alternate locations to distribute travel burden

- Create a fair rotation of locations across team geographies
- Implement location selection processes that consider all team members
- Design travel support that acknowledges varying needs
- Build awareness of visa and international travel challenges

### 3. Balance structure and flexibility

- Create clear objectives and agendas
- Implement sufficient unstructured time for organic connection
- Design activities that accommodate different preferences and energy levels
- Build in both work-focused and relationship-building components

### 4. Capture and extend value

- Document key insights and decisions
- Implement processes for continuing momentum
- Create artifacts that capture the retreat experience
- Build follow-up mechanisms for action items

{% include callout/example.html content="Consider structuring bi-annual team retreats with a consistent pattern: Day 1: Arrival and welcome activities, Day 2: Strategic alignment and cross-team collaboration, Day 3: Team-specific deep dives and problem-solving, Day 4: Structured social experiences and celebration, Day 5: Reflection and action planning. This consistent structure creates clear expectations while allowing flexibility in the specific activities. Alternating between European and North American locations distributes travel burden, while providing extra travel days for team members coming from greater distances ensures fairness." %}

This comprehensive approach addresses all aspects of the experience rather than leaving important elements undefined.

## 2. The ROI of In-Person Events

These gatherings are significantly more cost-effective than maintaining physical offices.

**Implementation approach**:

### 1. Calculate the financial case

- Compare costs of periodic gatherings versus permanent office space
- Implement budget planning that acknowledges this investment
- Create visibility into the financial advantages of this approach
- Build understanding of the long-term ROI

### 2. Measure the impact on collaboration quality

- Track collaboration metrics before and after gatherings
- Implement feedback mechanisms to assess impact
- Create visibility into relationship effects
- Build awareness of how in-person connection supports remote work

### 3. Design experiences for maximum return

- Focus on activities with enduring impact
- Implement experiences that address specific team needs
- Create meaningful memories that strengthen connection
- Build in opportunities for addressing challenging topics

### 4. Communicate the strategic importance

- Clearly articulate the purpose and value of gatherings
- Implement communication that sets appropriate expectations
- Create understanding of how these events support remote work
- Build organizational commitment to this investment

{% include callout/example.html content="You might calculate that twice-yearly week-long company retreats cost approximately 15-20% of what you'd spend on office space, utilities, and commuting costs for the entire company. Yet the impact on team cohesion and productivity is substantial. Tracking team effectiveness metrics before and after retreats consistently shows improvements in cross-team collaboration, issue resolution speed, and reported job satisfaction in the months following each gathering." %}

This ROI-focused approach makes strategic investments that pay dividends through enhanced effectiveness.

## 3. Project Kickoff Gatherings

For larger organizations, bringing project teams together at launch creates alignment and relationship foundation.

**Implementation approach**:

### 1. Focus on building shared understanding

- Create clarity on project objectives and success criteria
- Implement activities that align understanding of user needs
- Design experiences that build shared context
- Build team cohesion through collaborative problem-solving

### 2. Create artifacts that serve as reference points

- Document key decisions and rationales
- Implement visual representations of project approach
- Create resources that capture shared understanding
- Build reference materials for future team members

### 3. Establish working agreements and communication patterns

- Define team norms and collaboration approaches
- Implement communication protocols and tools
- Create explicit decision-making frameworks
- Build shared expectations for remote collaboration

### 4. Develop personal connections

- Design activities that reveal working styles and preferences
- Implement relationship-building experiences
- Create understanding of individual strengths and perspectives
- Build foundation for trusting remote collaboration

{% include callout/example.html content="When launching significant new initiatives, consider bringing the core project team together for a three-day kickoff. The first day can focus on building shared understanding of the problem space and creating personal connection. The second day might be dedicated to aligning on approach and making key decisions. The third day then transitions to remote work planning, establishing norms, tools, and practices the team will use for ongoing collaboration. Teams often report that this initial investment dramatically reduces miscommunication and accelerates progress in the critical early stages." %}

This focused approach creates the foundation that enables effective work going forward.

## 4. Department-Level Connect Events

For companies with 50+ people, organizing department gatherings creates deeper connection within functional areas.

**Implementation approach**:

### 1. Rotate throughout the year

- Stagger department gatherings to distribute travel and impact
- Implement planning calendars that coordinate across departments
- Create equitable rotation of timing and locations
- Build company-wide awareness of department gathering schedule

### 2. Focus on team building and long-term planning

- Design activities specific to department needs
- Implement both social and work-focused components
- Create opportunities for deeper skill development
- Build shared understanding of department direction

### 3. Cross-pollinate between departments

- Include representatives from related departments
- Implement cross-functional components
- Create visibility into department activities
- Build awareness of interdependencies and collaboration opportunities

### 4. Create balance with company-wide events

- Design department events to complement company retreats
- Implement consistent elements across departments
- Create clear understanding of different event purposes
- Build coordination between different gathering types

{% include callout/example.html content="Each department (Engineering, Product, Marketing, etc.) might hold a 3-day in-person gathering once per year, staggered throughout the calendar. Engineering could meet each January to plan architecture evolution, while marketing teams gather in March for strategy development, and so on. These focused gatherings allow for deeper department-specific work while company-wide retreats focus more on cross-functional alignment and relationship building." %}

This layered approach creates appropriate structures at different levels of the organization.

# Best Practices for IRL Events {#chapter-9-7}

To maximize the value of in-person gatherings:

## 1. Plan Activities That Build Lasting Relationships

**Implementation approach**:

### 1. Design experiences that reveal authentic selves

- Create activities that showcase talents and interests beyond work roles
- Implement structured sharing of personal stories and backgrounds
- Design experiences that reveal values and motivations
- Build opportunities for meaningful conversation

### 2. Balance structured and unstructured time

- Create explicit social activities
- Implement sufficient free time for organic connection
- Design varied experiences to accommodate different preferences
- Build in both high-energy and reflective components

### 3. Create shared memories

- Design memorable experiences unique to each gathering
- Implement activities that involve shared challenges
- Create traditions that carry forward between events
- Build documentation of shared experiences

### 4. Focus on inclusion

- Design activities accessible to all team members
- Implement alternatives for varying abilities and preferences
- Create balance between group and individual experiences
- Build respect for different comfort levels with social interaction

{% include callout/example.html content="You might find that shared experiences with elements of novelty, challenge, and play create the strongest lasting bonds. For example, cooking classes where mixed teams prepare a meal together, guided outdoor adventures appropriate to the location, and creative workshops led by local artists often work well. These experiences create conversation topics and shared references that continue long after the in-person gathering ends." %}

This intentional approach recognizes that human connection is fundamental to effective collaboration.

## 2. Respect Personal Boundaries

**Implementation approach**:

### 1. Make accommodations for those who can't travel

- Create meaningful remote participation options
- Implement equitable treatment for non-traveling team members
- Design ways to include remote participants in social activities
- Build understanding of various travel limitations

### 2. Balance work and social components

- Create clear expectations about required participation
- Implement opt-in options for social activities
- Design varying levels of engagement options
- Build respect for personal time and space

### 3. Consider diverse needs and preferences

- Create options for different energy levels and interests
- Implement accommodations for dietary requirements and physical needs
- Design activities that work across cultural contexts
- Build awareness of neurodiversity in social preferences

### 4. Establish clear expectations in advance

- Create detailed agendas with participation expectations
- Implement clear communication about logistics and requirements
- Design preparation materials that set context
- Build understanding of event goals and approaches

{% include callout/example.html content="Being very explicit about which parts of in-person gatherings are required versus optional can make a significant difference. Core working sessions and team meals might be required, while evening activities and recreational components can be optional. Providing quiet spaces for those who need breaks from social interaction and explicitly communicating that taking care of personal needs is encouraged and respected helps everyone participate comfortably." %}

This balanced approach provides clear structure while respecting individual needs.

# Maintaining Connection Between Gatherings {#chapter-9-8}

In-person events create relationship foundations, but ongoing connection requires deliberate practices:

## 1. Create Rituals That Transcend Physical Distance

**Implementation approach**:

### 1. Establish recurring team rituals

- Design weekly or monthly connection points
- Implement traditions that create continuity
- Create shared experiences despite physical distance
- Build anticipation through consistent patterns

### 2. Balance structured and spontaneous interaction

- Create both scheduled and ad-hoc connection opportunities
- Implement systems for organic interaction
- Design spaces for non-work connection
- Build permission for human connection

### 3. Celebrate milestones and achievements

- Design recognition practices that work remotely
- Implement consistent celebration rituals
- Create visibility for accomplishments
- Build appreciation into team culture

### 4. Acknowledge life events

- Create appropriate ways to recognize personal milestones
- Implement support systems for life challenges
- Design inclusive celebration approaches
- Build human connection beyond work roles

{% include callout/example.html content="Establishing 'Friday Wins' as a weekly ritual can be powerful, a 30-minute optional gathering where people share both professional and personal achievements from the week. The format can be lightweight: a quick round of shout-outs followed by anyone who wants to share something they're proud of or grateful for. This simple practice creates regular connection points between more substantial in-person gatherings." %}

This continuity approach creates predictable patterns that make connection natural and expected.

## 2. Leverage Digital Tools Thoughtfully

**Implementation approach**:

### 1. Create digital spaces for social connection

- Design virtual "water cooler" spaces for casual interaction
- Implement interest-based channels and groups
- Create permission for appropriate social chitchat
- Build systems that facilitate serendipitous connection

### 2. Implement virtual social activities

- Design lightweight virtual social events
- Implement varied formats to appeal to different preferences
- Create optional but engaging connection opportunities
- Build traditions that work in virtual formats

### 3. Facilitate one-on-one connections

- Design random coffee pairing programs
- Implement mentoring and buddy systems
- Create channels for skill sharing and mutual support
- Build networks that cross team boundaries

### 4. Focus on human stories

- Design storytelling opportunities
- Implement personal highlights in team communications
- Create visibility into team members as whole people
- Build narrative around team journey and milestones

{% include callout/example.html content="Tools like Donut can randomly pair team members for virtual coffee chats every two weeks. With participation being opt-in, you might find about 80% of your team chooses to join. These 15-30 minute conversations create cross-team connections that wouldn't happen organically and help maintain the relationships that form during in-person gatherings." %}

This thoughtful use of technology focuses on using the right tools for the job rather than technology for its own sake.

# Moving Forward {#chapter-9-9}

## Definition of Done

8. The organization values human connection as essential infrastructure

## Recap

Remote work offers a chance to fundamentally rethink how we build software and organizations. When you embrace its unique characteristics rather than fighting them, you unlock capabilities that traditional co-located teams struggle to match: 24-hour development cycles, global talent pools, and resilience to disruption.

The startups that will thrive in this new landscape aren't those with the most sophisticated remote tools or the strictest monitoring systems. They're the ones building cultures of trust, systems that reduce friction, and communication patterns that transcend time zones.

As a founder or executive, your job isn't to control remote work—it's to harness its inherent advantages while thoughtfully addressing its challenges. Done well, remote-first can become your competitive edge in attracting talent, moving quickly, and building an organization that's resilient by design.

## Final Thoughts

This completes our journey through remote excellence, but it's really just the beginning of yours.

You now have a comprehensive framework for building distributed teams that unlock capabilities traditional co-located teams struggle to match. The 24-hour development cycles, global talent pools, and resilience that remote-first organizations enjoy are natural outcomes of thoughtful systems design applied to human collaboration.

The path forward isn't perfect implementation of every technique. It's selecting approaches that fit your context, experimenting with what works, and continuously refining based on real feedback from real work.

Remote work, done thoughtfully, creates possibilities that don't exist in traditional environments. Your remote journey starts with trust as your operating system and evolves into something more powerful: an organization designed around human potential rather than physical proximity.
