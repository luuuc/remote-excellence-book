Build it.

Not a policy document that lives in a wiki and nobody reads. A real system. How decisions get made. How information flows. How people know what's expected. How work actually happens.

Write it down. Refine it constantly. Question everything regularly.

Trust your people to operate within it.

Then get out of the way.
