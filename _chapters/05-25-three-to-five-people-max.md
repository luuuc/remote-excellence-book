Small teams move fast.

Communication overhead grows exponentially with team size. Two people: one connection. Five people: ten connections. Ten people: forty-five.

Remote amplifies this. Every additional person is more coordination, more context sharing, more potential for miscommunication.

Keep teams small. Three to five people is ideal. They can stay aligned without elaborate processes. They can make decisions without endless meetings.

If a project needs more people, consider breaking it into smaller pieces with clear interfaces—not throwing more bodies at a single team.

Small teams are simpler. Simpler is faster.
