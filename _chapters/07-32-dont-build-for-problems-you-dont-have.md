# Don't Build for Problems You Don't Have

Don't over-engineer too early.

There's a temptation to build enterprise-grade processes for a ten-person team. Org charts. Approval workflows. Detailed documentation standards.

This slows you down. It creates overhead you don't need yet. It optimizes for problems you don't have.

Add structure when you feel pain.

Communication breaking down? Add a new channel or ritual. Decisions unclear? Document the process. Knowledge getting lost? Build a wiki.

Wait for the problem. Then solve it.

Structure should follow need, not anticipate it.
