In an office, you absorb context by osmosis. You overhear conversations. You see who's talking to whom. You pick up signals.

Remote teams don't have that luxury.

So you make the invisible visible. On purpose.

Share the reasoning behind decisions, not just the outcomes. Document what was considered and rejected. Make your thinking public.

When people understand the why, they don't need to guess. They don't assume the worst. They trust the process because they can see it.

Opacity breeds suspicion. Transparency builds trust.
