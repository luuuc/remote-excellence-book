# Stop Watching Your Employees

You can't monitor remote workers. Not really.

You can install tracking software. You can require cameras on. You can count keystrokes and log hours.

And you'll get exactly what you measure: performance theater.

The alternative is trust.

Trust isn't naive. It's pragmatic. When you assume people are competent and well-intentioned, you stop building systems to catch the exceptions. You start building systems that enable the majority.

Surveillance optimizes for the 5% who might slack off. Trust optimizes for the 95% who want to do great work.

Pick your optimization target.
