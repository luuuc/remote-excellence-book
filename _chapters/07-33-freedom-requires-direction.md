Remote enables autonomy. People work independently, make decisions, move fast.

But autonomy without alignment is chaos.

Everyone moving in different directions isn't productive. It's entropy. You need shared understanding of where you're going and why.

Create that alignment explicitly.

Clear goals. Clear priorities. Clear decision-making frameworks. Then let people loose.

The more aligned people are on direction, the more autonomous they can be on execution.

This isn't a paradox. It's the whole point. Strong alignment enables strong autonomy. Weak alignment requires constant coordination.

Invest in alignment. It pays dividends in speed.
