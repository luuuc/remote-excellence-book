# Turn Off Your Notifications

Your team is drowning in pings.

Every tool wants attention. Every channel demands response. The red dots multiply.

This creates anxiety, not productivity. People respond to what's urgent, not what's important. Deep work becomes impossible.

Declare bankruptcy.

Turn off most notifications. Check channels on a schedule, not on demand. Create explicit norms about response time expectations.

The fear is that something critical will slip. It won't. Critical things have a way of reaching you. Everything else can wait until you're ready.

Calm teams do better work than frantic ones.
