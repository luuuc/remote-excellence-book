Meetings should be rare.

When you call a meeting, you're saying: this topic is so complex, so nuanced, so dependent on real-time interaction that async won't work.

Most topics don't qualify.

Before scheduling, ask: can this be a document? A Loom video? A written proposal with comments?

When you do meet, make it count. Agenda in advance. Decisions recorded after. No meeting without an artifact.


**The math of meetings:**

A one-hour meeting with 8 people isn't one hour. It's eight hours of your company's time, plus the context-switching cost for everyone before and after.

That meeting needs to create at least eight hours of value. Most don't come close.

Remote teams that meet constantly are usually compensating for poor written communication. Fix the writing. The meetings will decrease.
