Some people need constant direction. They wait to be told what to do. They escalate every decision.

Remote will break them.

In distributed teams, you can't tap someone on the shoulder for guidance. You can't read body language. You have to figure things out, move forward with imperfect information, and ask for help only when you're genuinely stuck.

Hire people who've demonstrated autonomy. Who've built things without supervision. Who've owned projects end-to-end.

Past behavior predicts future behavior. If someone's always worked in high-touch environments with lots of oversight, remote will be a difficult transition.
