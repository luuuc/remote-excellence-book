Your remote employees work from home. Make sure home works.

A good chair. A proper desk. A monitor that doesn't strain their eyes. Reliable internet. These aren't perks. They're tools.

You'd never ask an office worker to bring their own desk. Don't ask remote workers to subsidize their workspace.

Provide a budget. Make it generous. Let people choose what works for them. Some need standing desks. Some need quiet headphones. Some need better lighting.

The investment is tiny compared to office rent. And the returns are immediate: fewer back problems, less eye strain, better focus, higher output.

A developer working on a laptop at a kitchen table will never match one with a proper setup. You're not saving money by skimping on equipment. You're losing productivity.

Fund the workspace. It's not charity. It's infrastructure.
