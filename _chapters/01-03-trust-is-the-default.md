Don't make people earn trust. Start with it.

Give new hires real responsibilities immediately. Full system access. Meaningful work. The message: we believe you're capable.

Most organizations do the opposite. Limited permissions. Probation periods. Gradually expanding access as people "prove themselves."

That's the wrong signal. It says: we're watching. We're waiting for you to fail.

The rare person who betrays trust will reveal themselves either way. But the approach you take shapes everyone else's experience.

Default to trust.
