# Let Night Owls Be Night Owls

Not everyone peaks at 9am.

Some people do their best thinking at 6am before the house wakes up. Others hit their stride at 10pm when it's quiet. Some need a midday break and work in two shifts.

Offices force uniformity. Everyone arrives at the same time. Everyone leaves at the same time. Individual rhythms don't matter.

Remote can be different.

If outcomes matter more than hours, let people work when they're sharpest. The night owl shouldn't pretend to be a morning person. The parent who works around school pickup shouldn't apologize.

Define availability windows when people can be reached for collaboration. Outside those windows, let them structure their own days.

You'll get better work from someone doing four focused hours at their peak than eight scattered hours fighting their biology.

Trust people to know themselves.
