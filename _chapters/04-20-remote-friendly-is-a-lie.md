There's a massive difference.

Remote-friendly means offices exist, and remote workers can dial in. They're accommodated but not centered. Meetings happen in conference rooms with one remote person on a screen. Decisions happen in hallways.

Remote-first means everything is designed for distributed work. Even people in the same city communicate as if they weren't. Meetings are everyone-on-video or async. Documentation is the default.

Remote-friendly creates two classes of employee. Remote-first creates one.

If you have an office and remote workers, you're probably remote-friendly.

That's a problem.

Commit to remote-first or go back to the office.

The middle ground serves no one well.
