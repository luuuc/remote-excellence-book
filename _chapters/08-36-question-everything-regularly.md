# Question Everything, Regularly

Your remote processes will break.

What worked at five people won't work at fifteen. What worked last quarter won't work next quarter. The tools you chose will show their limits. The rituals you loved will become stale.

This isn't failure. It's evolution.

Build in regular reflection. What's working? What's not? What should we try?

Keep it simple. A monthly async thread where people share friction points. A quarterly review of your communication architecture. An honest look at which meetings still earn their time.

The teams that struggle are the ones that set processes once and never revisit them. They accumulate cruft. Small annoyances become big obstacles. Nobody remembers why things are done this way.

Remote work is a practice, not a destination. You're never done improving it.

Question everything. Regularly.
