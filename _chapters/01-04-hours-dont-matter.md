You can't see people working. Stop trying.

In offices, visibility creates the illusion of productivity. Bodies in chairs. Fingers on keyboards. The appearance of effort.

Remote strips that away. All you have is the work.

This is a feature, not a bug.

Define what done looks like. Track whether it happens. Ignore everything else.

The person who ships in four focused hours is more valuable than the one who grinds for twelve. Remote makes that obvious.
