You've read the book. Now what?

Don't try to change everything at once.

Pick one thing.

Do it tomorrow. Here's your menu:

**If you're drowning in meetings:**<br>
Cancel your daily standup. Replace it with a written update. Due at the start of each person's day. "What I did. What I'm doing. What's blocking me." Try it for two weeks. You'll never go back.

**If you're exhausted by notifications:**<br>
Turn them off. All of them except your emergency channel. Check Slack three times a day instead of three hundred. Tell your team you're doing it and why.

**If information is scattered everywhere:**<br>
Pick one place for documentation. Move the three most important docs there today. Add one doc per day until the migration is done. Redirect every "where do I find X?" question to the new location.

**If trust is broken:**<br>
Uninstall the tracking software. Today. Have honest conversations with the people you were surveilling. It will be uncomfortable. It will also be the beginning of a real relationship.

**If your tools are multiplying:**<br>
List every tool your team uses. Pick the three that matter. Sunset the rest. Give people a month to migrate anything important.

**If you've never met in person:**<br>
Book the offsite. Don't wait for the "right time." Pick a date, pick a city, and send the invites. Figure out the details later.

**If you're hiring:**<br>
Add a writing sample to your interview process. A real one, not a cover letter. Ask candidates to explain something complex in writing. Weight it heavily.
