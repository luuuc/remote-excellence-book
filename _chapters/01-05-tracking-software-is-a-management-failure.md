  description: Tracking software doesn't fix performance problems - it just creates new ones for everyone. One person failing doesn't justify surveilling the entire team. Have conversations instead.

When things go wrong, there's a temptation to monitor more closely.

Deadline slipping? Check in more often. Quality dropping? Require more updates. Trust broken once? Watch everyone.

This is backwards.

If someone isn't delivering, that's a conversation—not a software purchase. Tracking tools don't fix performance problems. They just make the symptoms visible while creating new problems for everyone else.

Address issues directly. One person failing doesn't justify surveilling the team.
