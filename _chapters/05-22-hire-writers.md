In remote work, writing is a core skill.

Clear writers think clearly. They explain context. They anticipate questions. They make async communication work.

Poor writers create confusion. Every message needs follow-up. Every document raises more questions than it answers.

When you hire for remote, look at how candidates communicate in writing:
- Are their emails clear?
- Do their application materials make sense?
- Can they explain complex ideas simply?
- Do they structure information logically?

This isn't about grammar or prose style. It's about clarity of thought. Good writing is good thinking made visible.

**Try this in your next interview:**

Ask candidates to write something during the process. A brief proposal. An explanation of their last project. Feedback on a mock document. Watch how they organize their thoughts.

A brilliant engineer who can't communicate in writing will struggle in remote environments. Factor that into your hiring—heavily.
