# The Office Is a Crutch

Offices hide dysfunction.

Poor communication? Fixed by walking over. Unclear decisions? Clarified at lunch. Missing context? Absorbed by proximity.

Remote exposes all of this. Suddenly the problems are visible. And people blame remote.

But remote didn't create the dysfunction. It revealed it.

The companies that struggle most with remote work are the ones that never built real systems for communication, decision-making, and knowledge sharing. They relied on physical presence to paper over the gaps.

Remote forces you to build those systems. That's painful. It's also valuable.

The systems you build for remote make you better at work itself.
